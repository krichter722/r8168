release date: 2008/04/02
driver version: 8.006.00
1. Modify phy parameters for RTL8111C. 
2. RTL8168B/8111B, RTL8168C/8111C and RTL8168CP/8111CP support Jumbo Frame

release date: 2008/01/09
driver version: 8.005.00
1. Fix hibernate and cannot wakeup issue.
   The root cause: In rtl8168_init_board, tp->dev is never assigned. Therefor, it is a NULL pointer and the system crashes when this pointer is accessed.
   Solution: Assign a vaild memory address to tp->dev.
2. Modify GPHY parameters of RTL8111C
3. Modify GPHY configurations of RTL8111C
4. Create a spin lock to protect GPHY configuration.
5. Implement a kernel timer to rescue the NIC after the PCI reset is triggered.

release date: 2007/11/21
driver version: 8.004.00
1. Support linux kernel 2.4.x(2.4.20 and latter).
2. G-PHY reset remedy: 
	(a) The driver waits until the bit 15 of BMCR taggle and configues the capability of ANAR, GBCR and BMCR. (driver waits 2.5 sec)
	(b) Turn to page 0 before configure ANAR, GBCR and BMCR to prevent the
phy from being configured wrongly.
3. Do an amendment of multicast registers, since the sequence of multicast registers (MAR0 - MAR 7) are different from that of RTL8110 series.
4. Amendments of G-PHY accessing fuctions.
5. Add accessing functions of E-PHY.
6. Add accessing functions of CSI.
7. Check null pointers in rtl8168_rx_interrupt to prevent the driver from crushing.
8. Modify rtl8168_asic_down().
9. Implement SIOCGMIIPHY, SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCSMIIREG.
10.support linux kernel 2.6.23.

release date: 2007/08/17
driver version: 8.003.00
1. Modified the loopback not to use the accept all bit in Rx Config
2. The payload of a loopback packet is given by application.
3. Added strip in Makefile to reduce the size of driver.
4. Solved the compiling issue of FC2
5. Supported linux kernel 2.6.21 and 2.6.22
6. Supported nway force an true force.
7. Tinkered with the phy parameters of RTL8111C 
8. Since the different hardward structure, the csum offload registers of RTL8168B and RTL8168C/CP are different. Therefore, implement the csum function for RTL8168C/CP.

release date: 2007/07/07
driver version: 8.002.00
1. Update the default IC version.
2. Implement the private ioctl for Realtek
3. Support RTL8168CP/8111CP
4. Revise the readme to notice the users to check the built-in driver and
remove it if found.
5. turn on the phy when the driver is loaded.

release date: 2007/04/13
driver version: 8.001.00
1. This driver is modified from the r8169.c in Linux kernel 2.6.18 and
supports Linux 2.6.x only.
2. Support RTL8168C/8111C, the Realtek PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC.
3. Support RTL8168B/8111B, the Realtek PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC.
